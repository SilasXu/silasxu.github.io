        "abstract": "Proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has turned smart homes into a convenience and cyber vulnerability center. We herein present an advanced machine learning framework for the task of intrusion detection in a smart environment. Another unique resource for ML-based cybersecurity applications is provided by the compilation of a large dataset \"Smart Home Intrusion Detection Dataset\"that encapsulates diverse attributes of network traffic, specific to smart home IoT devices. This dataset contains all sorts of features, from connection durations to traffic patterns at the granularity of services, which are of utmost importance in distinguishing normal operation from possible security breaches. Using this data, we formulate a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms and put our efforts into ensemble methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. We rigorously test it on different training and validation sets, leading to the best performance, in turn making it score high for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We look into model behavior in more detail with the use of a confusion matrix, which refines further the predictive capability of the system. Our approach is set in the context of strict feature selection, which serves the dual role of giving the best efficiency and making the model more scalable. The results demonstrate the fact that our ML model performs not only better in identifying intrusion attempts but also with fewer false positives, a consideration for practical deployment. This also enhances the strategic defense of smart home ecosystems against an oncoming wave of cyber threats. This further endorses the viability of ML for developing adaptive, responsive intrusion detection systems - a step ahead in security measures for the IoT.",

        "abstract": "The development and use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have grown significantly in recent years. Advanced IoT device characteristics are mainly to blame for the wide range of applications that may now be achieved with IoT devices. Corporations have begun to embrace the IoT concept. Identifying true and suitable devices, security faults that might be used for bad reasons, and administration of such devices are only a few of the issues that IoT, a new concept in technological progress, provides. In some ways, IoT device traffic differs from regular device traffic. Devices with particular features can be classified into categories, irrespective of their function or performance. Ever-changing and complex environments, like a smart home, demand this classification scheme. A total of 41 IoT devices were employed in this investigation. To build a multiclass classification model, IoT devices contributed 13 network traffic parameters. To further preprocess the raw data received, preprocessing techniques like Normalization and Dataset Scaling were utilized. Feature engineering techniques can extract features from the text data. A total of 117,423 feature vectors are contained in the dataset after stratification, which are used to further improve the classification model. In this study, a variety of performance indicators were employed to show the performance of the logiboosted algorithms. Logi-XGB scored 80.2% accuracy following application of the logit-boosted algorithms to the dataset for classification, whereas Logi-GBC achieved 77.8% accuracy. Meanwhile, Logi-ABC attained 80.7% accuracy. Logi-CBC, on the other hand, received the highest Accuracy score of 85.6%. The accuracy of Logi-LGBM and Logi-HGBC was the same at 81.37% each. Our suggested Logi-CBC showed the highest accuracy on the dataset when compared to existing Logit-Boosted Algorithms used in earlier studies.",

        "abstract": "Air pollution is a global geo-hazard with significant implications, including deterioration of health and premature death. Climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall, wind, and humidity impact air pollution by affecting the strength, transportation, and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. Emerging data science tools, particularly Machine Learning (ML) big data analytics, are being utilized to predict air pollution intensity and frequency under varying climatic conditions for effective mitigation plans. However, comprehensive documentation of these digitalization approaches and outcomes in terms of correlating future air pollution with climate change remains scant. This study addresses this gap by systematically reviewing pertinent literature on climate change and air pollution studies. We also investigated the potentials of integrated spatial data science for spatial modelling and identifying cities vulnerable to air pollution hazards. Our findings show that climatic factors and seasonal variations are critical predictors of air quality in urban areas. A strong correlation exists between climate change and air quality, and air quality in urbanized regions is projected to deteriorate with climate change in the future. Therefore, climatic variables remain essential factors for the prediction of air quality. Also, air pollutants tend to have higher concentration in the warm season, making the consideration of seasonal changes crucial in air quality management. The study also revealed that machine learning algorithms such as random forest, gradient boosting machine, and classification and regression trees (CART) accurately predict air pollution hazard when integrated with spatial models. The detailed review of literature undertaken in this study provides a strong basis for the conclusion that the integration of spatial techniques and machine learning has the potential to improve air pollution prediction outcome and aid appropriate intervention initiatives by the stakeholders. Thus, emerging geospatial intelligence technologies and digital innovations particularly Artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data analytics that underpin the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) can enhance existing early warning mechanisms and support a prompt and effective response to climate-change-induced air pollution, thereby fostering sustainable cities and societies.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, sustainability is the core of green technologies, being a critical aspect in many industries concerned with reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption optimization. While this concern increases, the number of cyberattacks causing sustainability issues in industries also grows. These cyberattacks impact industrial systems that control and monitor the right functioning of processes and systems. Furthermore, they are very specialized, requiring knowledge about the target industrial processes, and being undetectable for traditional cybersecurity solutions. To overcome this challenge, we present SUSAN, a Deep Learning-based framework, to build anomaly detectors that expose cyberattacks affecting the sustainability of industrial systems. SUSAN follows a modular and flexible design that allows the ensembling of several detectors to achieve more precise detections. To demonstrate the feasibility of SUSAN, we implemented the framework in a water treatment plant using the SWaT testbed. The experiments performed achieved the best recall rate (0.910) and acceptable precision (0.633), resulting in an F1-score of 0.747. Regarding individual cyberattacks that impact the system's sustainability, our implementation detected all of them, and, concerning the related work, it achieved the most balanced results, with 0.64 as the worst recall rate. Finally, a false-positive rate of 0.000388 makes our solution feasible in real scenarios.",

Noting the importance of using sustainable energies to run the world for the rest of this century, much research has focused on applying machine learning techniques to renewable and sustainable energies, and a comprehensive, well-organized, reader-oriented review of that research is needed. This review organizes the essential basics, major applications, and remaining challenges of machine learning in sustainable energies into two parts to accommodate the background knowledge and interests of both artificial intelligence and sustainable energy experts. First, the major applications of machine learning are divided into prediction, clustering, and optimization. For each category, the literature is categorized from new viewpoints, and research trends are highlighted to focus future research. In the second part, three primary machine learning\u2013driven sustainability areas are introduced with respect to their abundance in the literature: multi-carrier energy systems, spatiotemporal analytics, and circular integration. For each engineering area, the contemporary progress is investigated in terms of a specific future research path. It is anticipated that the rapid application of machine learning tools will speed the development of sustainable energies during the next decade.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements and developments in artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches have shifted the manufacturing practices towards the fourth industrial revolution, considered as Industry 4.0 practices. A positive impact of AI-based techniques on sustainability can be seen in manufacturing organisations\u2019 at the system, product and process levels. Adopting AI-based strategies in manufacturing improves decision making, productivity and system performance. Despite sustainability and other benefits, the adoption of AI-based approaches in manufacturing organisations is still limited due to employees\u2019 knowledge and digital skills. In the present time, due to the digitalisation of manufacturing activities, intelligent sensors, and supply chain activities, industries are facing challenges with the generation of high volume, different variety and velocity of data. This data can be helpful for manufacturing organisations to enhance their performance and sustainability. However, managing this big data is still a significant challenge due to a lack of knowledge and limited literature. Deep learning (DL) based models can be a suitable choice to provide advanced analytics tools for manufacturing data processing and analysis. However, literature on the DL is still limited in the manufacturing context with its relationship to sustainability. The present study discusses the evolution of DL approaches in manufacturing and different DL-based models. This study also highlights how DL-based approaches can enhance the sustainability performance of industries. In the study, primary research areas, i.e., fault diagnosis, quality management, and predictive maintenance, have been discussed. Finally, a conceptual DL-based framework is proposed for the manufacturing industries to enhance their sustainability performance in manufacturing activities.",
